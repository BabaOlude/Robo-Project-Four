Robo Project Four

Deep Learning Project
In this project I will demonstrate the use of a fully convolutional neural network. The FCNN will be used to identify and follow a character in the simulation environment. The identified person in this assignment is known as a hero. There are many other characters in the simulation which serve the purpose of making the project more challenging because the goal is to follow the hero.
